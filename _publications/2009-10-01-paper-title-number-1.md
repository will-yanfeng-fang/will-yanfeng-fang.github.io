excerpt: 'We investigate the causal effects of China’s 1999 College Expansion (“the Expansion”) and the resulting increase in college attainment using sharp Regression Discontinuity Designs. We find heterogeneous treatment effects across regions and hukou status, but no significant heterogeneity by gender or parental background. A placebo test using a fake cutoff confirms that the rise in college attainment is uniquely driven by the Expansion for most subgroups; however, mild pre-existing trends among individuals with agricultural hukou and those with CCP-affiliated parents suggest caution when interpreting heterogeneity related to institutional characteristics. Whether these findings generalize to the recent, more aggressive expansions at the graduate and doctoral levels remains uncertain and warrants further research.'

I hold an M.A. in Economics from the University of British Columbia, where I also completed a B.Sc. in Food and Resource Economics. I currently work as a Research Assistant to Professor [Nathan Nunn](https://nathannunn.arts.ubc.ca/) at UBC, contributing to academic research through data engineering, applied econometric analysis, and the production of high-quality research outputs.

My research interests are in political economy, cultural economics, economic history, and anthropology.

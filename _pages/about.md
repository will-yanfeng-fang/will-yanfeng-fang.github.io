Born and raised in Shenzhen, China, I grew up speaking Teochew, Cantonese, and Mandarin. I completed high school at Shenzhen (Nanshan) Concord College of Sino-Canada, where I took 9 AP courses and began my journey in education as an IELTS Teaching Assistant at SEG Training Centre in 2019.

In 2020, I started at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the Land One Program and later majored in Food and Resource Economics. My academic path has been broad and interdisciplinary—I’ve taken courses in econometrics, causal inference, finance, accounting, international trade, environmental economics, and even remote sensing.

Since 2022, I have worked as an Academic Assistant and Teaching Assistant for Economics and Statistics courses at UBC, supporting 500+ students across multiple disciplines. My passion for education also led me to tutor both university and K–12 students across Canada and China, collaborating with 10 different institutions.

I recently graduated from the Master of Arts in Economics at the Vancouver School of Economics (UBC). But I haven’t stopped there—I currently work as a Research Assistant to Professor Nathan Nunn, where I apply statistical analysis, economic reasoning, and coding skills to real-world challenges and academic publications.
